# Optional-unwrapping

 Very simple example for optionals unwrapping (guard, if let, chaining) (Swift 4.1)
 
 Theory:
 
 + Optionals
   * Optionals are a powerful feature in Swift language which come to solve the problem of non-existing values.
 
 + If let
   * Safely unwraps optional value
 
 + Guard
   * Guard provides early exit of function
 
 + Force unwrapping
   * Must be 100% sure that value exists (if value will not be there than app will crash)
 
 + Optional chaining
    * Optional chaining is a feature that allows to call properties and methods on an optional that might currently be nil.
